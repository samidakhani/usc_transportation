STEPS FOR COMPILING JAVASCRIPT

NOTE:
      I have set my jdbc connection to Oracle database as:
      myConn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:orcl","system","system");
              Format----------------                 ("connection_string","Username","password")
     Format---ConnectionString="jdbc:oracle:thin:@Hostname:Port:SID"

      Please check the jdbc connection,username and password on the system being executed

1. Create a folder named 'Usc_transport' on Desktop.

2. Place the 2 files in the 'Usc_transport' folder.
         a. 'databaseDriver'
         b. 'sdoapi'

3. Right click on the file 'databaseDriver' and perform 'Extract Here'.
   The extracted files will appear in the same 'Usc_transport' folder.
   This folder will contain 3 folder that are extacted.Namely
        a.'javax'
        b.'META-INF'
        c. 'oracle'

4. Now, in the 'sdoapi' zip folder Go to 'oracle' folder
          ie 'Usc_transport'--->'sdoapi'--->'oracle'
  You will find a folder named 'sdoapi'.
  Copy this folder.

5. Paste the copied folder into 'oracle' folder found at 'Usc_transport'--->'oracle'.
   Now we are done with configuring the JDBC.

6. Copy and Paste the 'Hw2.java' file into the 'HomeWork2' folder.

7. Open the command prompt.

8. Execute the following command  -----'cd Desktop\Usc_transport'.
   
9. Execute the following command  -----'javac usc_transport.java'.

10.Execute the following command  -----'java usc_transport window student 200 200 400 400'.
   This executes the 1st query.Similary execute the remaing queries.
