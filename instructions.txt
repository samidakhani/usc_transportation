STEPS FOR COMPILING JAVASCRIPT

NOTE:
      I have set my jdbc connection to Oracle database as:
      myConn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:orcl","system","system");
              Format----------------                 ("connection_string","Username","password")
     Format---ConnectionString="jdbc:oracle:thin:@Hostname:Port:SID"

      Please check the jdbc connection,username and password on the system being executed

1. Create a folder named 'Homework2' on Desktop.

2. Place the 2 files in the 'Homework2' folder.
         a. 'databaseDriver'
         b. 'sdoapi'

3. Right click on the file 'databaseDriver' and perform 'Extract Here'.
   The extracted files will appear in the same 'Homework2' folder.
   This folder will contain 3 folder that are extacted.Namely
        a.'javax'
        b.'META-INF'
        c. 'oracle'

4. Now, in the 'sdoapi' zip folder Go to 'oracle' folder
          ie 'Homework2'--->'sdoapi'--->'oracle'
  You will find a folder named 'sdoapi'.
  Copy this folder.

5. Paste the copied folder into 'oracle' folder found at 'Homework2'--->'oracle'.
   Now we are done with configuring the JDBC.
